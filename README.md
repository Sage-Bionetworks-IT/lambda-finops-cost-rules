# lambda-finops-cost-rules

A lambda for generating the JSON string used by the Rules property of an
AWS::CE::CostCategory CloudFormation resource.

## Design

This lambda is intended to transform the chart of accounts returned from
[lambda-mips-api](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks-IT/lambda-mips-api),
combined with current AWS account tags, into cost-category rules (JSON string)
appropriate to pass to the
[`Rules` property for `AWS::CE::CostCategory`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ce-costcategory.html#cfn-ce-costcategory-rules).

This lambda will query `lambda-mips-api` for a chart of accounts (a mapping of
program codes and program names), and query AWS Organizations for account-level
cost-tracking tags.

Cost categories are created for each program listed in the chart of accounts.

Tags may exist on either individual cloud resources or on their containing
accounts which assign the resource costs to a particular program category. A
list of tag names that may contain program assignments are provided as a
template parameter.

### Category Rules

Cost-category rules are created to assign line item costs to a category based on
tags for the line item resource or its containing account.

The order of the rules matters because processing will stop at the first match.
For more information on rule processing, see the
[AWS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/manage-cost-categories.html).

#### Program Code Category

The rules generated for a Program Code category are dependent on the output of
`lambda-mips-api` for a list of current codes, as well as the current account
tags.

First, this lambda will create cost-category rules that check a list of tags
(provided as a template parameter) for every combination of program code and tag
name, then also create rules for each account with an appropriate tag, and
finally create rules to inherit the value from a listed tag if no other rule
matches.

### Template Parameters

The following template parameters are used to configure Cloudformation resources

| Template Parameter | Description                                       | Example Value                                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DnsName            | Custom host name to use for API Gateway           | cost-rules.example.com                                              |
| AcmCertificateArn  | AWS ARN of an ACM certificate valid for `DnsName` | arn:aws:acm:us-east-1:\<ACCOUNT ID>:certificate/\<CERTIFICATE UUID> |

The following template parameters are passed through as environment variables

| Template Parameter | Environment Variable | Description                                                                | Example Value                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| ChartOfAccountsURL | ChartOfAccountsURL   | URL to the chart of accounts endpoint provided by `lambda-mips-api`        | https://lambda-mips-api.execute-api.amazonaws.com/accounts |
| ProgramCodeTagList | ProgramCodeTagList   | Comma-separated list of tag names that may contain program-code assignment | CostCenter,CostCenterOther                                 |

### Triggering

The function will trigger on a nightly schedule, and can also be triggered
manually via API Gateway endpoints.

The CloudFormation template will output the available endpoint URLs for manually
triggering the lambda, e.g.: `https://<DnsName>/program-codes`

The API Origin can also be used to construct an alternate URL by appending the
stage name and endpoint path, e.g.: `https://<ApiDomain>/Prod/program-codes`

### Output

This lambda will write a JSON object to an S3 bucket containing data to be passed
to a Rules property of an AWS::CE::CostCategory resource. The rules generated
are based on external state (current AWS account tags and output from another
lambda).

The rules for the Program Code category will be written to a file named
`cost-categories/program-code-rules.yaml`.

Example state and its expected output are listed below for each endpoint.

#### Example Program Code External State

The program-codes endpoint queries two remote sources for their current state:
the current chart of accounts from `lambda-mips-api` and current account tags
from AWS Organizations.

Example chart of accounts returned by `lambda-mips-api` at `ChartOfAccountsURL`:

```json
[
    "000000": "No Program / 000000",
    "000001": "Other",
    "123456": "Program Part A",
    "654321": "Other Program"
]
```

Example existing AWS account tags:

| Account ID   | Tag value from a tag listed in `TagList` |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| 111122223333 | `Program Part A / 123456`                |
| 222233334444 | `Program Part B / 123456`                |
| 333344445555 | `Other Program / 654321`                 |

#### Example Program Code Output

The program-codes endpoint will produce the following rules from the above
state:

```json
[
    {
        "Type": "REGULAR",
        "Value": "123456 Program Part A",
        "Rule": {
            "Tags": {
                "Key": "CostCenterOther",
                "Values": [ "123456" ],
                "MatchOptions": [ "ENDS_WITH" ]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "Type": "REGULAR",
        "Value": "123456 Program Part A",
        "Rule": {
            "Tags": {
                "Key": "CostCenter",
                "Values": [ "123456" ],
                "MatchOptions": [ "ENDS_WITH" ]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "Type": "REGULAR",
        "Value": "123456 Program Part A",
        "Rule": {
            "Dimensions": {
                "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT",
                "Values": [ "111122223333", "222233334444" ],
                "MatchOptions": [ "EQUALS" ]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "Type": "REGULAR",
        "Value": "654321 Other Program",
        "Rule": {
            "Tags": {
                "Key": "CostCenterOther",
                "Values": [ "123456" ],
                "MatchOptions": [ "ENDS_WITH" ]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "Type": "REGULAR",
        "Value": "654321 Other Program",
        "Rule": {
            "Tags": {
                "Key": "CostCenter",
                "Values": [ "123456" ],
                "MatchOptions": [ "ENDS_WITH" ]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "Type": "REGULAR",
        "Value": "654321 Other Program",
        "Rule": {
            "Dimensions": {
                "Key": "LINKED_ACCOUNT",
                "Values": [ "333344445555" ]
                "MatchOptions": [ "EQUALS" ]
            }
        }
    },
    {
        "Type": "INHERITED_VALUE",
        "InheritedValue": {
            "DimensionName": "TAG",
            "DimensionKey": "CostCenterOther"
        }
    },
    {
        "Type": "INHERITED_VALUE",
        "InheritedValue": {
            "DimensionName": "TAG",
            "DimensionKey": "CostCenter"
        }
    }
]
```

This string can be passed to the
[`Rules` property for `AWS::CE::CostCategory`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ce-costcategory.html#cfn-ce-costcategory-rules).


### Example Usage

The output of this lambda is intended to be used when creating
AWS::CE::CostCategory resources in CloudFormation, but can easily grow beyond
the 4096 character limit for parameters. And so the data is written to S3 so
that it can be referenced by an AWS::Include transform, for example:

```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: 'All Cost Categories'
Resources:
  ProgramCodeCostCategory:
    Type: 'AWS::CE::CostCategory'
    Properties:
      Name: 'Program Code'
      'Fn:Transform':
        Name: 'AWS::Include'
        Parameters:
          Location: 's3://<OutputBucket>/cost-categories/program-code-rules.yaml'
```

## Development

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome.

### Setup Development Environment

Install the following applications:

- [AWS CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-cli)
- [AWS SAM CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-sam-cli)
- [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit)
- [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv)

Check in [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml) to see how they are installed for this
repo.

### Install Requirements

Run `pipenv install --dev` to install both production and development
requirements, and `pipenv shell` to activate the virtual environment. For more
information see the [pipenv docs](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).

After activating the virtual environment, run `pre-commit install` to install
the [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) git hook.

### Update Requirements

First, make any needed updates to the base requirements in `Pipfile`, then use
`pipenv` to regenerate both `Pipfile.lock` and `requirements.txt`.

```shell script
$ pipenv update --dev
```

We use `pipenv` to control versions in testing, but `sam` relies on
`requirements.txt` directly for building the lambda artifact, so we dynamically
generate `requirements.txt` from `Pipfile.lock` before building the artifact.
The file must be created in the `CodeUri` directory specified in
`template.yaml`.

```shell script
$ pipenv requirements > requirements.txt
```

Additionally, `pre-commit` manages its own requirements.

```shell script
$ pre-commit autoupdate
```

### Create a local build

Use a Lambda-like docker container to build the Lambda artifact

```shell script
$ sam build --use-container
```

### Run unit tests

Tests are defined in the `tests` folder in this project, and dependencies are
managed with `pipenv`. Install the development dependencies and run the tests
using `coverage`.

```shell script
$ pipenv run coverage run -m pytest tests/ -svv
```

Automated testing will upload coverage results to [Coveralls](coveralls.io).

### Run integration tests

Running integration tests
[requires docker](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/sam-cli-command-reference-sam-local-start-api.html)

```shell script
$ sam local invoke Function --event events/event.json
```

## Deployment

### Deploy Lambda to S3

Deployments are sent to the
[Sage cloudformation repository](https://bootstrap-awss3cloudformationbucket-19qromfd235z9.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)
which requires permissions to upload to Sage
`bootstrap-awss3cloudformationbucket-19qromfd235z9` and
`essentials-awss3lambdaartifactsbucket-x29ftznj6pqw` buckets.

```shell script
sam package --template-file .aws-sam/build/template.yaml \
  --s3-bucket essentials-awss3lambdaartifactsbucket-x29ftznj6pqw \
  --output-template-file .aws-sam/build/lambda-template.yaml

aws s3 cp .aws-sam/build/lambda-template.yaml s3://bootstrap-awss3cloudformationbucket-19qromfd235z9/lambda-template/master/
```

## Publish Lambda

### Private access

Publishing the lambda makes it available in your AWS account. It will be
accessible in the
[serverless application repository](https://console.aws.amazon.com/serverlessrepo).

```shell script
sam publish --template .aws-sam/build/lambda-template.yaml
```

### Public access

Making the lambda publicly accessible makes it available in the
[global AWS serverless application repository](https://serverlessrepo.aws.amazon.com/applications)

```shell script
aws serverlessrepo put-application-policy \
  --application-id <lambda ARN> \
  --statements Principals=*,Actions=Deploy

## Releasing

We have setup our CI to automate a releases. To kick off the process just create
a tag (i.e 0.0.1) and push to the repo. The tag must be the same number as the
current version in [template.yaml](template.yaml). Our CI will do the work of
deploying and publishing the lambda.
